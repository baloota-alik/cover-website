We&#8217;re not here to debate which of these platforms is the best. Each has its loyalists and life is too short to get into that argument. There are undeniable differences between iOS and Android, however. This includes access to content blockers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a content blocker?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coverapp.me\/a-content-blocker-is-different-to-an-ad-blockers\/\">Many people conflate content blockers with ad blockers<\/a>. While this is understandable \u2013 online adverts <em>are<\/em> content, after all \u2013 the service offered by Cover is very different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, ad blockers stop popups, banners and videos from appearing when you visit a website. That&#8217;s certainly helpful, especially if said adverts drain loading speed, but it has no impact on sensitive images.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A content blocker such as Cover&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coverapp.me\/how-to-safely-hide-your-private-content-a-6-step-process\/\">automatically prevents unwanted images and videos from saving in your generic photo banks<\/a>. Before you shrug your shoulders and say that doesn&#8217;t sound like something you need, think carefully about this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider your presence in any groups on WhatsApp. The world&#8217;s most popular messaging app sees people share countless images, memes, jokes and videos. Unless you have explicitly told the app not to do so, WhatsApp will save these images to your phone&#8217;s camera roll. This means that anybody can see them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Now<\/em>&nbsp;do we have your attention? Thought so. When Dangerous Barry from the local pub shares an explicit image with your group, you may laugh and roll your eyes. If your kids use your phone and see this picture, the reaction may be different. A content blocker helps you feel better about handing over your smartphone to keep youngsters occupied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Android vs. iOS content blockers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We have established that content blockers are advisable. A question remains, though. What&#8217;s the difference between iOS and Android content blockers?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a word, Cover. We&#8217;re not being cryptic or self-aggrandising here. The reality is, Cover is the only photo vault app that offers automatic blocking and hiding of images. Baloota invented Auto-Hide<sup>TM<\/sup>, the software used to achieve such an aim.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does that have to do with Android and iOS? At the time of writing, Cover is only available for download on Android appliances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why is Cover Android-only?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dumpsterapp.mobi\/developing-an-android-app\/\">Developing an app<\/a>&nbsp;is a lengthy process that requires a particular skill set. More importantly, it needs experience in coding language. iOS and Android use different languages. It&#8217;s possible to create a cross-platform app, but these are typically a little more basic and lack finesse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, most app developers will pick a platform and tailor their offering accordingly. In the case of Cover, we opted for Android. There are several reasons for this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Globally, Android has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/272307\/market-share-forecast-for-smartphone-operating-systems\/\">substantially larger market share<\/a>. As a result, Cover can help and protect more people<\/li><li>The Google Play store is the biggest app market out there, and there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/best-app-stores-936652\/\">multiple third-party Android app stores<\/a>. Again, this provides more opportunities to help users<\/li><li>The technology invented and used by Baloota is considerably more compatible with the Java coding language than Apple&#8217;s preferences for Swift or Objective-C<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We never say never here at Baloota, so we will not claim that Cover will permanently remain Android-only. For now, however, if you&#8217;re looking for an effective content blocker, Android has the advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using Cover as a content blocker<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned, Cover will automatically block any content that could be deemed explicit. Just&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coverapp.me\/faq\/sensitivity-levels\/\">use the settings within the app to define explicit content<\/a>. We&#8217;re here to help, not act as a nanny state. Obscenity is in the eye of the beholder. From here, Cover will automatically scan every image that your phone or tablet receives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a picture is deemed explicit, Cover will automatically move it to the in-built photo vault. You&#8217;ll receive a notification of this, so you can still take a look if you so desire. If you consider the image unsuitable for your general camera roll, leave it under lock and key of the vault. Alternatively, delete it entirely.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I block content automatically on iOS?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As discussed, Cover is the only automatic content blocker on the market. As Cover is not available for download on iOS formats, this means you cannot prevent explicit images from reaching your phone through messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are steps that you can take to protect your phone from visits to inappropriate websites or viewing unwelcome content. We&#8217;ll discuss those in just a moment. Remain mindful of pictures that are auto-saved to your camera roll, though. If you want to shield innocent eyes, download a photo vault and check the settings of your apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blocking iOS content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run an iOS appliance, you can prevent certain websites or apps from being accessed. Head to&nbsp;<strong>Settings<\/strong>, then&nbsp;<strong>General<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Screen Time<\/strong>. Here, you&#8217;ll be able to set acceptable restrictions for your appliance under&nbsp;<strong>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on Content Restrictions. You can choose what a user can download from the iOS stores, including music with explicit lyrics and age-restricted movies or TV shows. You can set which apps have access to your photos, too, including WhatsApp. Be aware that such restrictions only relate to outgoing images, though. It will not block incoming pictures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, you&#8217;ll have three choices when it comes to Safari.&nbsp;<strong>Unrestricted Access<\/strong>&nbsp;is self-explanatory.&nbsp;<strong>Limit Adult Websites<\/strong>&nbsp;automatically prevents access to XXX sites but will not limit availability to social media or betting sites. You can add specific websites of concern.&nbsp;<strong>Allowed Websites Only<\/strong>&nbsp;provides access to carefully vetted sites. A selection is pre-installed, but you can add more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re running an iOS appliance, this is better than nothing. It&#8217;s no substitute for an effective content blocker, but it&#8217;s a start.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the same, if you&#8217;re weighing up your next phone and are on the fence between iOS and Android, access to Cover may be a dealbreaker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I install Cover?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re ready to install Cover on your Android device, we&#8217;re waiting to help you. Just&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector\">download the app for free from the Google Play store<\/a>. It really is as simple as that. Once you&#8217;re up and running, you can tweak your settings as you see fit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A content blocker such as Cover automatically prevents unwanted images and videos from saving in your generic photo banks. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":946,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":true,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[122],"tags":[124,84,92,123],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.6.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Android vs. iOS Content Blockers \u2013 What&#039;s the Difference? - Cover<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"There are undeniable differences between iOS and Android, however.
