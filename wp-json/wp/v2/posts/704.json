In the 21<sup>st<\/sup> Century, it&#8217;s easier than ever to communicate and share content in an instant. Unfortunately, the line between blessings and curses can often feel very narrow. This ability to share means that your smartphone is essentially the gatekeeper of your private life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself; are you the only person that uses your smartphone or tablet? Would you feel comfortable with a friend or family member casually browsing through your photo folder? Do you trust everybody in your social media and messaging feeds not to share explicit content?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you answered no to any of those questions, you need some cover. To be more precise, you need <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector\">Cover<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cover\u2019s Journey<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Founders of Baloota have extensive experience working with Android operating systems, including both internal systems and file systems. They often considered how they could use this knowledge to prevent the unwanted sharing of explicit content?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their journey began in 2019 after many conversations and a lot of research. . The initial process began with an analysis of a variety of types of content that would ultimately be used by machine learning technology to determine whether or not this is explicit content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This theory was tested with Yahoo (open NSFW) and further testing was conducted after the app was released. At this stage of development, the app received relatively positive feedback but they noticed that there were still too many inaccuracies. This ultimately led to Baloota developing their own AI (artificial intelligence) technology that could work to alleviate all the issues they had encountered in the past. Some technical aspects of developing the app included the development of a machine learning model which&nbsp; was optimised for mobile devices but can also run on non-mobile devices. This was created using a framework called Tensorflow Lite.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is Cover?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cover is an Android app from Baloota, dedicated to protecting your privacy.&nbsp;Cover achieves this aim in two ways; utilising Baloota\u2019s Auto-Hide<sup>TM<\/sup> AI technology, which auto-scans your device for any explicit content and locks it into a photo vault, or by automatically blocks any explicit content that you would not wish to see saved on your device. One of the most important features of this app is that you do not need to be connected to the internet at any time for Cover to work which means a gallery lock that works 24\/7 providing constant protection &amp; gallery privacy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cover creates a private vault within your smartphone or tablet, ensuring that photos and other content remain inaccessible without appropriate permission. A passcode will be assigned to this vault, and entry denied without it. You can also manually select images and content that is saved to your vault.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Auto-Hide<sup>TM<\/sup> is enabled, it constantly monitors your device for explicit content. Instant Blocking alerts you through a notification that any explicit content has been found, also \u2018blocking\u2019 the content from being viewed on your device. You also have use of a secure gallery vault where you can store any and all your private content \u2013 do not pass Go, do not collect $200. This protects you from the twin threats of prying eyes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cover provides an invaluable service. Firstly, the images stored on your device are your business and nobody else&#8217;s. You should not need to be concerned about external eyes somehow gaining access to your own content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps more importantly, you cannot control who sends content to your phone. This is especially likely in the age of WhatsApp and Telegram. The instant messaging apps often autosave images to your device&#8217;s internal image bank \u2013 whether you want them there or not. This opens up the risk of explicit material being saved to your device through no action of your own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Constitutes Explicit Material?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The definition of explicit content, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. You may share a risqu\u00e9 joke or meme with a friend that you would not dream of showing to your grandmother, but that doesn&#8217;t make it innately illicit. Cover understands this, which is why you can tailor your level of blocking and auto hiding content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cover operates a sliding scale of protection. The sensitivity of enabling you to regularly adjust the level of security that you need. The app has been carefully considered and designed to accommodate all possible needs, and each setting has an explanation in plain English that ensures you&#8217;ll know what you&#8217;re selecting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very top of the scale, Cover will automatically hide any explicit content and also block it from entering your smartphone or tablet. This offers an enhanced level of safety. Cover is skilled at acknowledging explicit material, but content can be mislabelled or misinterpreted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you&#8217;re an adult. You may want to make decisions entirely for yourself and are prepared to risk seeing explicit content. At the lowest end of the Cover security scale, you can choose to manually assign explicit content to your private vault on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, the happiest of mediums for most users lies somewhere in the middle. Nuance is not lost on Cover, and with eleven security settings to choose from, you&#8217;re certain to find a level of protection that meets your needs. This setting can be adjusted at any time with a simple swipe of the thumb, ensuring that Cover constantly evolves to keep your appliance clean of unwanted images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How Does Cover Work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The mechanics of Cover are built into the app, and by extension, your smartphone or tablet. Provided you have selected the appropriate permissions, Cover works constantly in the background, scanning content that reaches your appliance and working to hide or block unwelcome images. There is no need to connect to the internet to keep Cover operational. You are protected 24\/7. That\u2019s the Cover promise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why Use Cover?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many reasons to utilise Cover and our Auto-Hide<sup>TM<\/sup> technology. Examples of users that would gain the greatest benefit from the app include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Members of numerous social media and messaging groups, where jokes, memes and images tend to fly. Everybody has their own idea of what they consider acceptable to share. By downloading Cover, you will not need to constantly brace yourself against potentially distasteful content.<\/li><li>Parents that allow their children to use their smartphone. Letting a youngster play games while you finish some shopping or important tasks is a great way to keep them amused, but kids are nosy and have short attention spans. You may find that a game of Candy Crush has lost its lustre in favour of snooping through your private conversations or image galleries.<\/li><li>Email users that are besieged by spam and unsolicited missives. Potentially offensive language is one thing, explicit images are quite another. Cover can prevent a check of your email from becoming a hair-raising event.<\/li><li>Individuals that use a smartphone for both work and personal use. If your employer has a code of conduct surrounding the use of company-issued technology, Cover will prevent you from getting into trouble through no fault of your own.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg for how Cover can benefit you. Ultimately, Baloota is interested in just one aim \u2013 protecting your privacy. Naturally, this means that we have no access to your content ourselves and will never share your information with any third party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Get Covered Now<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you understand the advantages of Cover, it\u2019s time to bring this level of shielding to your own smartphone or tablet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to the Google Play store and download Cover now. This will leave you safe in the knowledge that your private documents remain exactly that \u2013 <em>private<\/em>. You can relax. We have you covered.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Cover journey began in 2019 after many conversations and a lot of research. .
