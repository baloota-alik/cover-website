Does your heart sink whenever somebody asks to borrow your phone or tablet, especially if it\u2019s a child? If so, take appropriate steps to ensure adult content is not visible on your device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you think you have nothing to worry about, consider blocking and restricting adult content. If you are a member of multiple groups on WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal, you have no control over what is posted in these threads. You may inadvertently end up with adult images and videos saved onto your camera roll. One person\u2019s offensive image is another\u2019s idea of banter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, you can avoid such scenarios. Cover automatically identifies adult content on your appliance and moves it to a secure, password-protected vault. In addition, take further steps to prevent such material from reaching your handset in the first place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Disable autosaving of images and videos<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout this guide, we will discuss how to restrict active access to adult content. However, you also need to ensure that your appliance is not autosaving inappropriate images and videos. As discussed, if you are a member of groups in messaging apps, this becomes increasingly likely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many apps will automatically save received images and files to your device. Use Cover to automatically scan for these and lock them away in a secure vault, keeping them from the eyes of the vulnerable. An additional step of security is advisable, though. If you can stop these images from being saved, why wouldn&#8217;t you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent autosaving of images from the most prominent messaging apps on the market, follow these steps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>WhatsApp&nbsp;<\/strong>\u2013 head to&nbsp;<strong>Settings\/Chats<\/strong>&nbsp;and disable&nbsp;<strong>Save to Camera Roll<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Telegram<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 click on&nbsp;<strong>Settings\/Data<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Storage\/Save Incoming Photos<\/strong>&nbsp;and deactivate all relevant settings<\/li><li><strong>Signal<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Signal will not automatically save images \u2013 this app is big on privacy. For additional security, consider restricting messages from anybody not in your contacts. This is achieved by heading to&nbsp;<strong>Settings\/Privacy\/Advanced<\/strong>&nbsp;and activating&nbsp;<strong>Sealed Sender<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Extra Steps<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also disable automatic downloading of images and videos in these apps. This way, if you do not trust the sender, you can leave the file in the cloud. It will only be viewed if you take the necessary action to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For an additional layer of security, apply a password to your messenger apps too. This way, as well as preventing images from being saved to a camera roll, they cannot be viewed within the context of a conversation. Facial recognition software is even better.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just be aware that Android&#8217;s technology is slightly less advanced than Apple&#8217;s patented Face ID and can be fooled with a photo. If you have a particularly enterprising child that you&#8217;re trying to protect from images, take additional security steps. We would recommend downloading Cover again, but we&#8217;re probably biased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Restrict downloads from Google Play<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now your device is protected from adult material that is received. Blocking access to passive content is just a small piece of the puzzle, though. You\u2019ll also need to prevent active access to inappropriate images or adult content<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step to this is restricting access to the Google Play app store. While other app stores are out there, Google Play has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/276623\/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores\/\">biggest global market share<\/a>. Alas, this store is also considerably less stringent than others when it comes to allowing third-party content. There is no way of knowing who may be uploading apps to the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open the Google Play App Store and head over to&nbsp;<strong>Settings<\/strong>, then look at the&nbsp;<strong>Parental Controls<\/strong>&nbsp;option. This will be set of Off by default. Flip this to On and select an appropriate level of security for your device. You\u2019ll be offered a range of age restrictions. The same can also be applied to any TV shows or movies saved on your phone. Be sure to use this setting if you do not want your pre-teens watching&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones<\/em>!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Manage search engine settings<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blocking access to certain apps is great, but adult content will still be available through websites. While some communication platforms are app-only, it\u2019s hardly a secret that the internet is a big place with some dark corners.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most Android appliances use Google Chrome as the default search engine. Chrome offers the opportunity for incognito browsing, which will not be recorded in the internet history of your appliance. You know, for buying a gift for somebody you do not want them to know about. If you believe that, you&#8217;ll delighted to hear that an overseas prince wants to gift you millions of pounds and just needs your bank details to make the transfer!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep web browsing safe, open the Chrome app and open&nbsp;<strong>Preferences<\/strong>. From here, open&nbsp;<strong>Search Settings<\/strong>&nbsp;and choose&nbsp;<strong>SafeSearch Filters<\/strong>. Opt to&nbsp;<strong>Filter Explicit Results<\/strong>&nbsp;and save your new preferences. This will prevent anything untoward from appearing in a Google search.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Block Websites<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, you may be concerned about a particular website that you do not want a child accessing. Be aware of some of the sites that fly under the radar as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.makeuseof.com\/tag\/sites-parents-add-block-list\/\">potential dangers to children<\/a>&nbsp;\u2013 or even vulnerable adults.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are multiple ways to block a website. Your internet provider should be able to offer this service, for a start. This will stop certain sites from being accessed anywhere using your Wi-Fi connection, whether that\u2019s using an Android appliance or a desktop computer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A smart child can get around this by deactivating Wi-FI and using 4G for browsing. It\u2019s safer to block sites outright using your appliance. If you head to&nbsp;<strong>Settings<\/strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>Safe Browsing<\/strong>, you\u2019ll restrict access to any kind of adult material.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, if you want to maintain access to all but a handful of sites, install a third-party app like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blocksite.co\/\">BlockSite<\/a>. Used in conjunction with Cover and the other security steps that we have outlined, this will keep your Android appliance clear of unwanted images and video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&nbsp;<em>ever&nbsp;<\/em>allow anybody else to use your phone or tablet \u2013 or even if you don\u2019t, but cannot be certain what images and videos will be shared in group chats \u2013 you should take these steps. Used in association with Cover, they will ensure that your appliance remains safe and sanitary for any potential user.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cover automatically identifies adult content on your appliance and moves it to a secure, password-protected vault.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":8,"featured_media":843,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[19],"tags":[86,85,84,87,89,88],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.6.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How to Block Adult Content from Your Android Device - Cover<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"How secure is your Android appliance?
