It\u2019s extremely important that you\u2019re aware of all of the ways you may be exposing yourself to harm while you\u2019re browsing the web or using apps on your phone.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Baloota Applications, privacy &amp; digital well-being is at the forefront of our minds every day. So we\u2019ve compiled five of the easiest ways you can keep your phone &amp; online accounts safe while preventing a photo vault password hack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use a Password<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t be part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.securitymagazine.com\/articles\/89220-half-of-consumers-dont-password-protect-their-mobile-devices\">52% of smartphone users<\/a> who don\u2019t protect their smartphone device with a password. Setting up a basic 4-digit passcode is by far the easiest way to ensure your phone has a basic level of protection. One of the worst case scenarios in today\u2019s world is accidentally misplacing your phone outside. What makes this hypothetical situation even worse is that anyone with the wrong intentions could access any data on your phone. That could involve anything from identity theft, stolen credit cards, social media profile hacking, and so much more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just use a passcode to protect your phone! Many Android offer heighted password security like a pattern lock and alphabetical passcodes. Long story short, the more difficult the password, the more difficult it is for someone to break in your device.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Don\u2019t Use Public Wifi<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into not using public wifi, it\u2019s even more important to know that you should turn off your wifi when you\u2019re not using it! It may be a hard habit to get into but it\u2019s worth it. By turning off wifi, you\u2019re saving battery life, lowering your chances of someone getting into your phone, and you\u2019ll also be less distracted by notifications!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re in a metro area frequently, resist the urge to connect to free city wifi, and free public wifi in general. Public, unsecured networks are arguably one of the biggest risks when it comes to internet safety. You should always use a secure, password protected network that\u2019s only available to you or other trusted individuals that are also using the network.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also consider using a virtual private network, or an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coverapp.me\/best-free-vpns-for-android\/\">Android VPN app<\/a> to take your security to the next level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Turn Off Bluetooth<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bluetooth isn\u2019t as susceptible to hacking as wifi is, however, it is still possible that you could get attacked if a hacker is around the same vicinity as you. It\u2019s not uncommon for smartphone hackers to linger around cafes, public transit, libraries, etc. to prey on unsecured\/open devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By setting your Bluetooth configuration to \u201cnon-discoverable\u201d by default, you mitigate the chance of someone tapping into your phone via Bluetooth nearby devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Research Apps Before Downloading Them<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Always research and do your due diligence on every app you install on your Android smartphone. It\u2019s always in your best interest to be safe rather than sorry. Read through Terms &amp; Conditions, watch YouTube reviews, read the developers app store reviews, and make sure the app is encrypted &#8211; especially if you\u2019re using it to store private information such as photos, texts, messages, contact information, credit card information, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Backup Your Content &amp; Data<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Backup your online information such as photos to the cloud. By doing this, you\u2019re protecting yourself if your phone is stolen or if one of your accounts gets hacked. It\u2019s also a great habit to practice to save phone storage. If you tend to hoard a lot of information and data on your phone, we especially recommend you do so.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/dumpsterapp.mobi\/best-android-cloud-backups-for-photos\/\">a list of the top cloud apps<\/a> if you\u2019re looking to download a trusted platform to use.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Need an Encrypted Vault to Hide Photos or Videos?
