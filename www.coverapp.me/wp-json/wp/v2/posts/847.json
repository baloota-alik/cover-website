This is particularly prevalent on the internet. One of the most common misconceptions is that a content blocker and an ad blocker are identical. These are different applications that offer varying services.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Do I need a content blocker if I have an ad blocker?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ad blockers are very popular online, with good reason. The internet feels like at the home of free information, but you&#8217;re smart enough to know that there&#8217;s a price for everything. In the case of browsing the web, that means exchanging your data for resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many times have you entered a website, clicked the box that allows the page to track Cookies to dismiss the annoying box, only to be bombarded with tailored advertising in the future? That&#8217;s because the site captured your browsing habits, known as &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/signal.co\/resources\/first-party-data\/\">first-party data<\/a>&#8220;, and is looking to convert your interest into a sale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Few people appreciate such aggressive sales tactics. A banner that covers the screen, or a video that slows down performance, is especially unwelcome. When an ad blocker is installed,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2015\/10\/02\/ad-blockers\">third-party content does not reach a user<\/a>. This speeds up loading times and reduces intrusions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ad blockers are sometimes referred to as content blockers. On paper, this makes sense. The ad blocker keeps content away from your screen. In reality, a content blocker is a separate piece of software that provides significantly more security for your device. If you share a phone or tablet, especially with children, consider installing a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coverapp.me\/\">content blocker like Cover<\/a>&nbsp;alongside your ad blocker.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Content blocker vs. ad blocker \u2013 what\u2019s the difference<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As discussed, an ad blocker has one job and performs it admirably. Install an ad blocker (free extensions are available for every major web browser) and you will no longer be bothered by pop-up adverts. Bad news for businesses that spent a fortune on digital marketing. Good news for internet users that simply want to surf the net in peace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A content blocker, however, takes your protection to the next level. A content blocker will prevent any kind of unwanted, explicit material or image from reaching your device. This is critical to retaining privacy online, especially if you are not using a VPN. What&#8217;s more, content blockers are not restricted to web browsers. Cover, for example, will also shield your text messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why use a content blocker?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet is a big place with no shortage of shady corners. It&#8217;s easy to take a wrong turn when following a hyperlink rabbit hole. This could leave you confronted with images that you were not expecting. Hackers often replace dead links on reputable articles with pornographic websites, for example.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By installing a content blocker, this malicious trick will be for nothing. A content blocker will pixelate, or outright blackout, images that are deemed explicit. If you use Cover, you&#8217;ll be able to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coverapp.me\/faq\/sensitivity-levels\/\">select your level of protection<\/a>&nbsp;and define &#8220;explicit&#8221; according to your terms.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rise of messaging apps has also increased the necessity for content blockers. Anybody that is a member of multiple groups will have no control over what images are shared. Unless you&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coverapp.me\/how-to-block-adult-content-from-your-android-device\/\">take action to prevent this from happening<\/a>, such images and videos will automatically be saved to your appliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a disaster waiting to happen if you share a phone with your children. Even if you&#8217;re single and child-free, how would you react if somebody asked to borrow your phone to make an emergency call? Believe it or not, some people still use smartphones as telephones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a rule of thumb, ask yourself a simple question. Is there any chance that your phone contains content you would not want your grandmother to see? If the answer is yes, be sure to install a content blocker post-haste.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What content blocker should I use?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having established that a content blocker is a must-have, you\u2019re faced with a choice as to which to choose. We recommend Cover, for reasons that may seem obvious. We can back up our confidence with performance, though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, Cover offers complete privacy and protection from unwanted content. Blocking a website is one thing, but content can still make its way to your device. Cover is a one-stop shop to completely shield your appliance from explicit images and videos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are happy to receive explicit images but want to keep them from prying eyes,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coverapp.me\/best-photo-vaults-for-android\/\">Cover is a hugely effective image vault<\/a>. This keeps your private files under a metaphorical lock and key. Only you will have the ability to access these images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you could use a website blocker like Qustodio to block and monitor internet access. These are designed with families in mind, so remain a fine choice if you have children. Qustodio, for example, can be used to block websites or telephone numbers, preventing messages from reaching an appliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have picked up on though, this is a broad approach that will not always pay dividends. These blockers prevent sites from being accessed, but a particularly crafty youngster may find a way around this. They also only block numbers from sending messages, not content. There is nothing to stop somebody from sending images from a different SIM. If this occurs, only Cover will shield the visuals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The appeal of ad blockers is obvious. If you find unsanctioned advertising frustrating, be sure to install such an extension to your browser. Just do not be confused by the terminology used by developers. An ad blocker is&nbsp;<em>not<\/em>&nbsp;a content blocker and will&nbsp;<em>not<\/em>&nbsp;shield innocent eyes from explicit images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.baloota.galleryprotector\">Install Cover today<\/a>&nbsp;alongside an ad blocker and your device will be completely secure. Not only will you escape the attentions of determined marketing teams, but you&#8217;ll also avoid any awkward interactions based on your messaging history. What&#8217;s more, a content blocker ensures that any explicit images are masked. This is ideal for anybody that shares a phone \u2013 and it prevents any nasty shocks for yourself too!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We may be living in the age of information, but there is still a lot of erroneous data in the world.
